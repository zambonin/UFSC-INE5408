Small assignments consisting of implementations for various data structures.

Files can be compiled by typing `make` or `make debug`, if one wants
debugging symbols.

A specific README for an assignment using some of these structures can be
found inside its respective folder. It can be compiled individually by
typing `make traffic`.

Remove all binaries with `make clean`.
