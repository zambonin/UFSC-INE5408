A traffic lights simulator using simple data structures. It can be compiled
by typing `make` or `make debug`, if one wants debugging symbols.

Run it with two integer arguments: total execution time units and a delay
for a given semaphore. The final car throughput sucks, just like real traffic.

    $ ./simulator 1000 1
